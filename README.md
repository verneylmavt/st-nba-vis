# üèÄ NBA Analysis and Visualization

This repository focuses on analyzing NBA player performance data across multiple dimensions such as age, position, and era. It aggregates season‚Äêlong statistics to provide insights into how players‚Äô per‚Äìgame production evolves over their careers and how league trends have shifted over time. The repository includes interactive visualizations that compare the performance curves of superstar players with league averages, highlighting key performance milestones and trends over different decades.

This repository also explores predictive modeling by developing regression models that forecast turnovers based on assists and personal fouls based on defensive statistics like steals and blocks. In addition, it features a classification model that predicts a player‚Äôs position from their performance metrics. These models offer insights into the relationships between various in‚Äìgame statistics and serve as tools to quantify player contributions in different aspects of the game.

This repository further delves into player similarity analysis by using unsupervised learning techniques. An autoencoder is employed to compress the multidimensional statistical profiles into latent representations, and nearest neighbor algorithms identify players with similar performance profiles. Dimensionality reduction methods are then used to visualize these relationships, providing a nuanced view of player comparisons across seasons.
